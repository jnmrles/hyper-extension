# Hyper Extension

A Chrome Browser Web Extension that automates the checkout process on a user's selected site by injecting JavaScript and jQuery into the specific site. This is specfically meant for sites that host limited product releases. Since these sites usually sell out within minutes, this extension helps a user checkout swiftly in seconds.

This project was built in a week and was scaled to 2,000+ Users for the software company Hyper Raffle bot. This has helped their users secure thousands of items.
